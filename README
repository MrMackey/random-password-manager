    Place this file in its own directory before running it to prevent
        accidental rewriting of coincidentally-named files.
        Recommended to also make it a hidden directory (starting with `.`)

    Running this file creates two files.
        1. `options.db`                 (Don't create or rename manually)
        Stores options. Not human readable. Rename if you wish on line 76.

        2. `file1.db`                    (Don't create or rename manually)
        Stores data.  Not human readable. Rename if you wish on line 77.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    Protect your sensitive information with some simple security measures:

        Rename this file to something else to prevent it being found easily.

        Ensure elevated privileges are required to run or modify associated
        files. This can be done by changing owner (and group owner)
        of this directory recursively to root (enter in a terminal):
        `sudo chown -R root:root /path/to/thisdirectory`

        The main menu gives you all the choices needed to manage your log
        in data. Except for 'delete all', which is intentionally not
        available. If you would like to delete all your data, you'll need to
        delete the DATA file from your system (named on line 77). If you have
        followed the advice above, this will again require your system
        password, keeping your data safer.

        Leaving this program open on your desktop is not safe, in case you
        step away from your computer, forget to log out, etc.
        Always quit immediately when you're done... it starts up quickly!
    _________________________________________________________________________
    To run, enter in a terminal:
        'sudo /path/to/thisfile'

    Simplify the run command to `xyz`.
        Instead of `xyz` choose any unique name, then enter in a terminal:
        `echo "alias xyz='cd /path/to/thisdirectory && sudo ./thisfile'" \
            >> /path/to/.bashrc`

    Restart your terminal. Then to run, just enter in terminal:
        `xyz`       (you should be prompted for your system p.w.)
    _________________________________________________________________________
    Multiple files:
    If you'd like to manage more than one set of data (for work vs home use,
    or for whatever reason) the best way is to create another separate
    directory and copy this file into it.  Follow steps above to easily have
    unique commands pointing to each copy.  In this case, each will have
    its own OPTIONS file (for email addresses, usernames & preferences) and
    its own DATA file and be completely separate.

    Note: you can copy the OPTIONS file into the new directory,
    if you wish.  For example, if you set up all your options first, then
    copy the OPTIONS and this file into a new directory, you don't have to
    enter your options again. Same for the DATA file, although it may be
    less useful to have the same data available in two locations...except as
    a backup.
